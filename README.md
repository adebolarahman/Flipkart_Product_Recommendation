# Flipkart product recommendation chatbot

End to end implementation of Flipkart products recommendation for users motivation from Satyajit Pattnaik. Streamlit app was added for less cost by not deploying on AWS.
This project aims to provide an end-to-end solution for Flipkart's product recommendation system. The key components include:

Workflows: The workflows handle various aspects of the recommendation system, such as data conversion, Streamlit app integration, and Flask app implementation.
Flipkartbot: A Streamlit app has been added to the project, which likely serves as a lightweight and cost-effective deployment solution compared to a full-fledged AWS setup.
Data: The project includes a data converter module, which suggests the handling of input data for the recommendation system.
Static and Templates: These folders seem to contain Flask-related files, such as static assets and templates, indicating the use of the Flask web framework in the project.
Docker: The project also includes Docker-related files, such as dockerignore and Dockerfile, which suggests the use of containerization for deployment or development purposes.
